# CONTEXT — Brasaland

**Milestone 2: Programming Fundamentals**  
**Company:** Brasaland — Grilled Food Restaurant Chain  
**Your Role:** Junior Developer, Brasaland Digital Team  
**Project Owner:** Felipe Guerrero, Operations Director

---

## About Brasaland

Brasaland is a grilled food restaurant chain with 14 company-owned locations across Colombia and the United States (Florida). The company focuses on consistent product quality, warm customer experience, and speed of service. You're part of Brasaland Digital, the internal team leading the company's digital transformation.

## Your Assignment

Felipe Guerrero, the Operations Director, needs you to build the core data processing logic for Brasaland's restaurant operations system. Currently, location managers handle everything manually — tracking sales, calculating margins, managing waste, and ordering ingredients. This milestone focuses on building the TypeScript functions that will power sales analytics, waste control, and location performance scoring.

This is pure programming — no AI, no prompting. Felipe needs code that works reliably across 14 locations in two countries with different currencies and regulations.

---

## What You're Building

You will implement a set of TypeScript utilities to:

1. **Model menu items, sales, and locations** using interfaces
2. **Filter and search sales data** by location, date, and product
3. **Calculate location performance scores** based on multiple metrics
4. **Compute financial metrics** (revenue, cost, margin) in multiple currencies
5. **Generate operations reports** with aggregated data
6. **Validate data** before processing

## Business Entities

### MenuItem

Represents an item on Brasaland's menu.

**Interface: `MenuItem`**

```typescript
interface MenuItem {
  id: string; // Menu item ID (e.g., "ITEM-PICANHA-250")
  name: string; // Item name (e.g., "Picanha 250g")
  category: MenuCategory; // Food category
  basePrice: Price; // Base price (can vary by location)
  ingredientCost: Price; // Cost of ingredients per unit
  prepTimeMinutes: number; // Average preparation time
  isAvailableInColombia: boolean;
  isAvailableInUSA: boolean;
  allergens: string[]; // List of allergens
  status: MenuItemStatus;
}

interface Price {
  USD: number; // Price in US Dollars
  COP: number; // Price in Colombian Pesos
}

type MenuCategory = "Meat" | "Side" | "Beverage" | "Dessert" | "Combo";
type MenuItemStatus = "Active" | "Seasonal" | "Discontinued";
```

**Validation Rules:**

- Both `USD` and `COP` prices must be > 0
- `prepTimeMinutes` must be > 0 and <= 60
- `name` must not be empty
- Item must be available in at least one country

---

### SaleTransaction

Represents a sale made at a Brasaland location.

**Interface: `SaleTransaction`**

```typescript
interface SaleTransaction {
  id: string; // Transaction ID (e.g., "TXN-2024-15482")
  locationId: string; // Location where sale occurred
  itemId: string; // Menu item sold
  quantity: number; // Number of units sold
  totalPrice: Price; // Total price charged
  paymentMethod: PaymentMethod; // How customer paid
  timestamp: Date; // When the sale occurred
  waiterName: string; // Staff member who served
}

type PaymentMethod = "Cash" | "Credit card" | "Debit card" | "Digital wallet";
```

**Validation Rules:**

- `quantity` must be > 0
- Both price values must be > 0
- `waiterName` must not be empty

---

### Location

Represents a Brasaland restaurant location.

**Interface: `Location`**

```typescript
interface Location {

  name: string; // Location name
  city: string; // City name
  country: Country; // Colombia or USA
  openingYear: number; // Year opened
  seatingCapacity: number; // Maximum number of customers
  staffCount: number; // Number of employees

  manager: string; // Location manager name
  status: LocationStatus;
}

type Country = "Colombia" | "USA";
type LocationStatus = "Active" | "Temporarily closed" | "Under renovation";
```

**Validation Rules:**

- `openingYear` must be >= 2008 and <= current year
- `seatingCapacity` must be > 0
- `staffCount` must be > 0

### WasteRecord

Tracks food waste at a location.

**Interface: `WasteRecord`**

```typescript
interface WasteRecord {
  id: string; // Waste record ID
  locationId: string; // Location where waste occurred
  itemId: string; // Menu item wasted
  quantity: number; // Number of units wasted
  reason: WasteReason; // Why it was wasted
  cost: Price; // Cost of wasted items
  timestamp: Date; // When it was recorded
  reportedBy: string; // Staff member who reported it
}

type WasteReason =
  | "Expired"
  | "Cooking error"
  | "Customer return"
  | "Damage"
  | "Other";
```

### 4. Location Performance Scoring (`src/utils/transformations.ts`)

**`scoreLocationPerformance(location: Location, sales: SaleTransaction[], wasteRecords: WasteRecord[], menuItems: MenuItem[]): number`**

Calculates a performance score (0-100) for a location based on:

- **Revenue performance (40 points max):**
  - Calculate daily average revenue (total revenue / number of operating days)
  - Operating days = days since opening (estimate from openingYear)
  - Score: (avg daily revenue in USD / 1000) \* 40, capped at 40

- **Efficiency (30 points max):**
  - Calculate seats efficiency: (total sales count / seating capacity) \* 30, capped at 30

  - Score: 20 - (waste percentage \* 2), minimum 0
  - Lower waste = higher score

- **Profit margin (10 points max):**
  - Use calculateLocationMargin function
  - Score: margin / 10, capped at 10

Returns total score rounded to 2 decimal places

**`rankLocationsByPerformance(locations: Location[], sales: SaleTransaction[], wasteRecords: WasteRecord[], menuItems: MenuItem[]): Array<{location: Location, score: number}>`**

- Scores all locations
- Returns them sorted by score (highest first)

## What Felipe Expects

> "Mira, we have 14 locations running every day. Your code needs to handle Colombian pesos and US dollars correctly, work with different time zones, and give me accurate numbers I can trust. No shortcuts. If the margin calculation is wrong, I'm making bad decisions. Build it right."  
> — Felipe Guerrero, Operations Director
