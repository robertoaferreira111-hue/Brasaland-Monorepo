## Milestone 1: Your Company's Public Website

_Estas instrucciones están disponibles en español._

This document describes your company and the specific situation you're building this milestone for. Read it completely before writing any code. Everything you build must reflect this context.

## Your company

Brasaland is a grilled food restaurant chain founded in 2008 in Medellín, Colombia. What began as a single family-run location has grown into a chain of 14 company-owned restaurants operating in Colombia and the United States (Florida). The company employs approximately 115 people between kitchen and floor staff, operations management, and the corporate team headquartered in Medellín with a commercial office in Miami. Annual revenue sits around 6 million dollars. The brand is built on three pillars: consistent product quality across every location, a warm and reliable customer experience, and speed of service.

## Your department and the problem you must solve

You work in Brasaland Digital, the internal team created by CEO Mariana Restrepo to lead the company's digital transformation, and you report directly to CTO Nicolás Park. Brasaland's current corporate website is from 2019, doesn't allow online orders, and only shows the menu. It doesn't reflect that the company operates in two countries or properly present the brand experience. Camila Ospina (Marketing Manager) needs a renewed website that professionally presents the brand, shows locations in both countries, and captures information from people interested in joining the digital loyalty program.

## Your stakeholder

Camila Ospina, Marketing Manager

Hi,

We need to relaunch our corporate website. It should present Brasaland as what we are: a serious grilled food restaurant chain with presence in Colombia and the United States. I want a landing page that explains our value proposition, shows our locations in both countries, and presents our new digital loyalty program "Brasa Points." I also need a page with a form so people can register for the loyalty program. We currently use physical stamp cards that get lost and generate no data. I want to capture: name, email, phone, country, city, favorite location, dietary preferences, and how they found us. The site must be responsive, accessible, and SEO optimized. Multilingual support (Spanish and English) is optional but highly recommended; start with one base language. Use Tailwind and make sure the validations work perfectly.

## Language scope

Multilingual support is optional but highly recommended given Brasaland's operations in Colombia and the United States.

You must choose one base language for the full website and form experience.

If you implement a second language, treat it as an enhancement (do not reduce quality/completeness in the base language).

## Landing page content

Your landing page must include the following sections, in this order:

### Header

- Logo or name "Brasaland"
- Language selector (ES | EN) if you implement a second language
- Navigation: Home | Locations | Menu | Brasa Points | Contact

### Hero

- Headline: "The taste of the grill, in every bite"
- Subheadline: "Since 2008 serving the best grilled meats in Colombia and the United States. 14 locations, one passion for quality and flavor."
- Call to action: Button "Join Brasa Points" linking to the form

### Our Story (paragraph + image)

Founded in Medellín in 2008, Brasaland began as a family dream: sharing the authentic taste of grilled meat with consistent quality and warm service. Today we are 14 restaurants in two countries, but we maintain the same recipe for success: fresh products, traditional techniques, and passion for every dish we serve.
